# ## Environment Variables

## Have a templated config for constants outside the core code
## Have a `.env` file but don't put it in version control
## `envsubst` utility is bundled with alpine docker image
## Provide environment variable values at the run time (`docker run --env MYVAR1=foo`)

## Local environments?
